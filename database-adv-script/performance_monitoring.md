# üîç Query Plan Analysis

```sql

EXPLAIN SELECT ...
```

## üî∏ Top-Level Operation: Hash Left Join
- Join Type: LEFT JOIN

- Tables Involved: booking (alias b) and location (alias l)

- Join Condition: b.property_id = l.property_id

- Cost Estimate: 66.55..104.84

- Purpose: This is the final join, ensuring all bookings are kept, even if no location match.

## üî∏ Inner Join: booking ‚Üî property
- Join Type: Hash Join

- Join Condition: b.property_id = p.property_id

- Cost Estimate: 52.50..79.06

## Nested Join: booking ‚Üî user
- Join Type: Hash Join

- Join Condition: b.user_id = u.user_id

- User Scan: Sequential Scan on "user"

- Cost: 0.00..10.50

- Rows: 50

##üî∏ Join: payment ‚Üî booking
- Join Type: Hash Right Join

- Join Condition: pay.booking_id = b.booking_id

- Explanation: Booking is preserved; results will include bookings without a matching payment.

- Scan Details:

- payment: Seq Scan (0.00..19.20, rows=920)

- booking: Seq Scan (0.00..17.20, rows=720)

## üìä Table Scan Summary
|Table	|Scan Type	|Estimated Rows|	Notes|
|-------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
|payment|	Seq Scan|	920	|Full scan|
|booking|	Seq Scan|	720	|Full scan|
|"user"|	Seq Scan|	50	|Light scan|
|property|	Seq Scan|	230	|Moderate load|
|location|	Seq Scan|	180	|Light scan|

## Performance Observations
- All tables are being fully scanned

- Indicates no WHERE clause or lack of indexes.

- Hash joins are efficient here

- PostgreSQL can handle small tables in memory.

- Hash Right Join is less common

- Can be rewritten as a LEFT JOIN for clarity.
